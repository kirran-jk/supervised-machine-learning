# supervised-machine-learning: Predicting Credit Risk

This repository contains code creating machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans.

The following models are used:
 * Logisitic Regression
 * Random Forest Classifier

Both models are created, fit and scored against the data, with the Logistic Regression model outperforming the Random Forest Classifier model.
